# Recruitment
Subjects will be recruited via a variety of means, including posted notices on- and off-campus, Penn’s SBSI platform, announcements on the lab website, social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), online electronic newsgroups, text/email/phone or newspaper advertisements,  CHOP/Penn medical record review and through the Brain Behavior Lab’s registry of previous research participants who have consented to be re-contacted about participating in future research, or by clinician referral from physicians within the Penn Medicine/CHOP system. 
Target: 2000 participants along with parents of minor participants to participate in virtual procedures. Of these, 500 participants will be asked to come in for non-contrast agent MRI procedures.

*Key Inclusion Criteria*:
- Age: 13-25. 
- Sex: Males and Females
- Proficiency in English
    - Mood and anxiety group: Mood and anxiety group must demonstrate evidence of a mood or anxiety disorder (All ICD codes encompassed by mood/anxiety disorders in DSM (excluding Bipolar Disorder I & II), Borderline personality disorder, Clinically significant affective instability from clinician referrals, Treatment with a SSRI, Elevated PHQ-9 scores administered during standard health system screening.)
    - Typically Developing Group: No current or documented history DSM IV axis I or II diagnosis, or use of psychoactive medications. 

*Key Exclusion Criteria*:
- Significant medical or neurological illness that may increase risk.
- Pregnancy
- Any history of pervasive developmental disorder or intellectual disability
- Documented history of a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or clinically significant current substance misuse 
- Non-psychiatric medical disorders that may impact brain function or visual acuity
- Lack of a mobile device with capabilities to complete study procedures
- Acute intoxication with alcohol or other substances based on clinical assessment, subject report, or results of laboratory testing
- For 3T and 7T participants only: contraindications/claustrophobia

#  Procedure
- Participants will perform self-report questionnaires, a neurocognitive battery assessment and both passive and active mobile data collection on the custom-built AWARE App.
- After consent, participants will be asked to complete a neurocognitive battery online, as well as self-report questionnaires and a computerized adaptive clinical interview.
- Participants will also be directed to download the AWARE app. There will be 2, 2-week periods of active survey collection 3 times per day, and passive data collection using the AWARE app for 6 months. EMA questions from the app will include questions related to mood, behavior, sleep, or other aspects pertaining to participants’ daily lives.
- In addition to survey data, AWARE will passively collect information pertaining to accelerometer data, GPS data, phone call and text messaging meta-data, all key-stroke data (with the exception of passwords), and phone/screen usage data. 
- A subsample of (500) participants will be brought in for imaging procedures.  Imaging visits will last approximately 2-3  hours and will be conducted at Penn/CHOP. 

# Compensation
_Participants will be reimbursed for travel (transportation and parking) expenses incurred on scan day._
_All participants will be paid virtually using Venmo or PayPal applications._
-  Payment for virtual participation: 
    - AWARE surveys:Subjects will receive $1 per survey they complete during each of the 2 weeks, with a $3 bonus for completing more than 75% of the surveys (up to $24/week.) Subjects will be paid $3 for each month of passive data collection (detailed below) for 6 months (up to $18).
    - Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (1 hour): Subjects performing cognitive testing with the standard Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) applied routinely in the Brain Behavior Laboratory will be paid $20.
